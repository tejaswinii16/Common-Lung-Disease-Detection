Artificial Intelligence project on: Pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images using an e ensemble of deep learning models

1. The use of deep learning techniques in medical imaging can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of pneumonia diagnosis, revolutionizing the field.
2. The project involves acquiring a diverse and annotated X-ray dataset, preprocessing the data, and training the models using fine-tuning techniques.
3. The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, with a focus on comparing the effectiveness of ResNet and DenseNet architectures.
4. The successful implementation of an accurate and efficient deep learning model can significantly assist radiologists, reduce human errors, and improve patient care and outcomes in pneumonia diagnosis.

In conclusion, this project focuses on developing a deep learning model using Renet and DenseNet architectures to detect pneumonia from X-ray images. Through a comprehensive methodology involving dataset preparation, model training, and comparative analysis, we aim to create an automated system that can aid in the accurate and efficient diagnosis of pneumonia. This research has the potential to contribute to the field of medical imaging and advance the development of intelligent systems for pneumonia detection.
